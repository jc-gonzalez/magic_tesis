X-ray Observatory show for the first time the full impact of the blast

explosion. Astronomers are thrilled to see these <a href="/docs/dict_ei.html#image" onMouseover="return image_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">images</a>
showing the progress of a supernova remnant in the making.
<p>&nbsp;SN1987A has been followed closely by astronomers since its appearance
in early 1987. It is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, our nearest
galactic neighbor visible from the Southern Hemisphere. About 200 days
after the initial appearance of the supernova, the <a href="/docs/dict_ei.html#IUE" onMouseover="return IUE_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">International
Ultraviolet Explorer</a> detected evidence for a ring of material around
the remains of the star. This ring had been ejected thousands of years
earlier in the death-throws of the star, but was only illuminated after
the explosion.
<p>&nbsp;X-rays were first detected from SN1987A in 1992 by
<a href="/docs/dict_qz.html#ROSAT" onMouseover="return ROSAT_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">ROSAT</a>.
The X-rays are emitted by hot gas (with temperatures of 10 million degrees
Celsius) following behind the shock wave emitted by the supernova explosion.
It has been expected that this shock wave would continue to expand through
the years.
<p>&nbsp;Recent observations of SN 1987A with the Hubble Space Telescope
revealed gradually brightening of hot spots in the ring of <a href="/docs/dict_jp.html#matter" onMouseover="return matter_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">matter.</a>
Chandra's X-ray images show the cause for this brightening ring. The shock
wave is smashing into portions of the ring at a speed of 10 million miles
per hour (4,500 kilometers per second).
<p>"With Hubble we heard the whistle from the oncoming train," said David
Burrows of Pennsylvania State University, University Park, the leader of
the team of scientists involved in analyzing the Chandra data on SN 1987A.
"Now, with Chandra, we can see the train."

<p>The X-ray observations appear to confirm the general outlines of a model
developed by team member Richard McCray of the University of Colorado,
Boulder, and others, which holds that a shock wave has been moving out
ahead of the debris expelled by the explosion. As this shock wave collides
with material outside the ring, it heats it to millions of degrees. "We
are witnessing the birth of a supernova remnant for the first time," McCray
said.
<p>&nbsp;The Chandra images clearly show the previously unseen, shock-heated
matter just inside the optical ring. Comparison with observations made
with Chandra in October and January, and with Hubble in February 2000,
show that the X-ray emission peaks close to the newly discovered optical
hot spots, and indicate that the wave is beginning to hit the ring.
<p>In the next few years, the shock wave will light up still more material
in the ring, and an inward moving, or reverse, shock wave will heat the
material ejected in the explosion itself. "The supernova is digging up
its own past," said McCray.
<p>The observations were made on October 6, 1999, using the Advanced CCD
Imaging <a href="/docs/dict_qz.html#spectrometer" onMouseover="return spectrometer_dtt()" onMouseout="nd();">Spectrometer</a>
(ACIS) and the High Energy Transmission Grating, and again on January 17,
2000, using ACIS. Other members of the team were Eli Michael of the University
of Colorado; Dr. Una Hwang, Dr. Steven Holt and Dr. Rob Petre of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD; and Professors Gordon Garmire
and John Nousek of Pennsylvania State University. The results will be published
in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal.
