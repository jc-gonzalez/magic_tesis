Edit your PostScript file, and insert at the beginning of the code section:

<</MirrorPrint true>> setpagedevice

If this does not work, substitute the previous line with

clippath pathbbox newpath
pop exch translate
pop -1 1 scale

If this also does not work, ask your publisher ...

The crop-package provides an option named mirror, which reflects a
whole document.
